# fun-electronics

This repository contains all the code that I am using with my Raspberry Pi and Freenove Starter kit for Raspberry Pi.

As Freenove only provides code in Python and Java, I am converting their code projects to Javascript, using NodeJS and Typescript.

# Install

npm install
or
yarn install

# Compile code

The compiled code can be found in the dist folder (not present in the initial repo, but will appear at first compile).

npm run dev
or
yarn dev

# Running the code

Run the compile code from the dist folder, each file is a project.

node ./dist/<project name>
